Taclashes were originally used by military organizations as a form of crowd control, and explorers and mercenaries came to appreciate the utility of the weapon. When a numbing taclash connects, a low electrical shock transmits through the lash. The shock is too mild to deal damage, but it can stun the target."

      "description": "This graceful, curving blade further increases the drama inherent in sword fighting. Carbon steel blades bite deeply, causing bleeding wounds. The blade of an ultrathin curve blade looks delicate, but it is as hard as carbon steel and keeps a fine edge. Buzzblade curve blades vibrate when powered, tearing organic flesh and causing additional bleed damage. Dimensional slice curve blades have only a narrow visible blade area, surrounded by a solid aura; these are the sharpest and most dangerous curve blades on the market."
